# Setup

This project automates the process of setting up Hacktiv8's workstations using a simple [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

To get more [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) packages [search here](https://caskroom.github.io/search).

## Getting Started

Open up Terminal.app and run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/github
cd ~/github
git clone https://github.com/hacktiv8/setup.git
cd setup
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Notes

The script does not reinstall apps that are already on the machine.
